# Edge Cameras for Detecting Human Presence

### Project Category: Safety

## Project's Story: Conception, Motivation, and Execution

This project was conceived when we, Jacqueline and I, were brain-storming about the final project of the Intel Edge AI Scholarship <https://www.udacity.com/scholarships/intel-edge-ai-scholarship>. 

**Semantic Segmentation for Self-Driving Cars with OpenVINO <https://youtu.be/Urph3UHLivY>**

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS AND COMMANDS

There are 2 ways to execute this project:
- via Udacity workspaces (the easy way);
- and by installing the OpenVINO toolkit in your computer (the hard way).

### Installation via Udacity workspaces
